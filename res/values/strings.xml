You can then adjust the crisper level accordingly to achieve the desired humidity. Every time you adjust the level, wait at least 5 minutes for the humidity to stabalize before attempting to adjust again.</string>
    <string name="inst2">The three buttons give you a basic idea of what the relative humidity should be for your produce. There are examples provided for each level. If the produce you have is not listed in any of the examples, choose a relative humidity for the category that most closely resembles your produce.</string>
